Helping dads since 2021

*An open source guide for first time fathers. This guide is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather is a brain dump of all the things we ended up buying and learning, leading up to day zero.*

## Conception
### What to expect
Sexy time
### What to buy
Helped identify when to conceive.
* https://www.amazon.com/Clearblue-Digital-Ovulation-Test-Tests/dp/B002VLYAOI


## 1st Trimester
### What to expect
Depending on when you find out, you could be somewhere in between to near the end of the 1st Trimester. We found out about halfway through and the first words out of my wife's mouth were "Oh shit, we're pregnant." That sums it up pretty well. 

After you find out, there is a really regular cadence of doctor visits and the doctors should guide you on what to do and what to expect.

Decide on when and who you would like to share the news with. Micarriages are highest from week 0 to week 6.

### What to buy
Pregnancy test.
* https://www.amazon.com/Clearblue-Digital-Pregnancy-Smart-Countdown/dp/B0000B11WE

I found that this book was really easy to read and was shocking accurate in what to expect on a weekly basis. It was not overwhelming and gave me some bits of organization in what seemed to be a really unknown part of our lives.

## 2nd Trimester
## What to expect
The 2nd Trimester is usually the easiest Trimester as the mother is past the nausea (if she had it) and the happy hormones have kicked in. If you are up for it, now is a good time to schedule a BabyMoon so that you two can get away one last time before the big day. 

### What to buy
We didn't buy anything, but we did sign up for various registries as they will be able to give you discounts on your eventual purchase.

## 3rd Trimester
### What to expect
Momma is getting big and it's getting real, and if it hasn't already happened, she will be starting to "nest," which is basically her getting the house in order for the special delivery. 

If you have individuals who can help, or you need help (nanny, night nurse, meal delivery service), now would be a good time to start looking into those items. 

Also be sure to pack a hospital bag for the delivery day so that you can just grab and go. Of all the items on this list, the real MVP was a portable speaker. Our baby had peaceful piano music playing the entire time and it was really calming for the entire family.

### What to buy

Here's most of what we bought from the registries. Most of these items took us well past 6-9 months. As for the options, there are a lot of online articles and reviews, but these are just what we bought and what we thought of them after really using them. 

### Stroller
**Stroller** - As an engineer, I thought the stroller was very well-engineered, but does lean on the heavy side. I believe the Cruz is a little lighter, but only has capacity for one baby.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z6Y5VCB?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I1HNU3NIDQK2K&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Infant Car Seat** - This car seat was amazing and worked with our stroller. Our baby ended up growing quite fast (87% for height) and we were able to use this up until 8 months. I know some people buy convertible car seats right out the bat, but now that we have a convertible seat, we think it would have been a bit too big for us, so we enjoyed having a smaller infant car seat to start with. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077JR43YY?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I2D8814PD7AJTE&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Stroller organizer** - Helpful place to put your phone, bottles, coffee, beer....etc.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M59QPSK?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I14PCASKK0IPMY&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

### Nursery
**Crib** - No frills crib. Clean design, nothing fancy, but safe and will grow with the baby.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VV4CNZ?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I1JQ6DR0O75ILB&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Infant Bed** - We liked that we can flip this when our little one got older. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C23MYQZ?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I355EKCC93JH94&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Bed Sheets** - We only had two sheets to start out with, but you really need at least 6 (or more) if you're sending your little one to daycare as the daycare will ask for some sheets as well. The reason is because if your little one has an accident (leaky diaper) or is sick (boogers EVERYWHERE), then you'll need to do laundry and it helps to have a few extra sheets. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6S5YSI?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I34ZW8XMH2FB1O&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Waterproof Crib Mattress Pad** - So no pee pee gets through. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PB9DJ4F?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I2OX2QOCHZ8PG9&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**White Noise Machine** - Really helpful in soothing the baby to sleep. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HD0ELFK?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I346Q856LT4A6I&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Sleepsacks or Swaddles** - Our little one was a houdini and would eventually find a way out, but the SwaddleMe's worked the best for us. We've heard good things about the Halo too. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TQB2G16?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I5O9MJUNTNC4A&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Storage Bins** - These worked well for us in keeping things organized.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y2FDVFH?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I75751QRSYZK5&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Hatch** - Simiar to a sound machine, but with more advanced options and ability to control through an app. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WFXGNGF?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I328X1BUS33MY&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Changing Pad Liner** - Helpful in keeping the blowouts from getting the mat dirty. We also used these as portable changing pads when out and about.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NV7RX7H?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I1AUXPHUO1R4YZ&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Baby Monitor (Audio)** - We ended up using our Miku most of the time, but this was helpful as a first response.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JEV5UI8?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=IKSCAESUT8LI9&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Baby Monitor (Video/Audio)** - We used this all the time. It's not perfect, as it was often a bit laggy and slow, but it did the job and we slept a bit more soundly knowing our little one was breathing.
https://www.amazon.com/Miku-Smart-Baby-Monitor-Mount/dp/B0915DGHBB/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=miku&qid=1639718717&s=baby-products&sr=1-2

**Crib Mobile** - Kinda fun for our little one to watch when he woke up.
https://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Toy-Wimmer-Ferguson-Infant-Stim-Mobile/dp/B00W89SX2S/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=manhattan+toy+mobile&qid=1639721965&sr=8-3

**Mobile to Go** - We put this on the stroller and car seat to keep our little one busy.
https://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Toy-Wimmer-Ferguson-Infant-Mobile/dp/B008ZB5E2K/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=manhattan+toy+mobile&qid=1639721965&sr=8-1



### Feeding
**Baby Bottles** - We quickly moved to exclusive bottle feeding and pumping, so we got these bottles because they were easier to clean than most. But, they would sometimes leak if the lid was not on correctly. Overall, decent bottle. We've heard great things about the Dr. Brown bottles too. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0767QWD4G?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I1X6WYW5H8HHDV&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Bottle Sterilizer** - We LOVED this. It saved so much time.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VBXKG2?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I2RYIW04ASTNYT&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Drying Rack** - I'm surprised this is not in the museum of modern art. Super cute and VERY practical.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OR1DTC?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I22WIG1V2P0FUI&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Bottle Warmer** - Really only had one job, which is to warm up water so that you can warm a bottle. Straightforward and worked well. One wish is that it had a timer as well.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LJ64JR4?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=IGRNBK5VWWBZZ&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**High Chair** - It's kinda heavy, but it does have wheels and we ended up wheeling our baby to other areas (like the kitchen when we cooked dinner), which was quite helpful. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C6ZD793?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I2O2QYRYQ3PWSJ&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Spoons** - Very smell and soft, so our little one could even play with it.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071G54J8K?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I3RIEDOFB5DBUJ&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Burp Cloths** - We ended up using the burp cloths as bibs during feeding, so we ended up having about 10 of them. Also helpful for cleaning up spills and of course spit up from burping. We were also gifted a bunch of the longer ones that drape over the shoulder and they worked really well too.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T1RF4FN?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I1Y9LQAERYC4H2&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Water Learner Cups** - Holds water. Has handle for holding.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0835TC6JY?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I3DASABUVBW0AT&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Baby Food Bowl** - We had some silicon ones, but our baby ended up flicking the food by grabbing the lips of the bowl. This bowl made it a lot harder to flick food and would suction down to the table.
https://www.amazon.com/Avanchy-Feeding-Bamboo-Spill-Suction/dp/B010FDQRX0/ref=sr_1_21?keywords=baby%2Bfood%2Bbowl&qid=1639717909&sr=8-21&th=1

**Pacifier** - We used these two.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0835MTX4T?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I30PH2G56NNTDB&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Pacifier Clip** - Helpful to keep the pacifier from flying all over the place. Our little one ended up chewing the little silicon beads too. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QYKWKDQ?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=IBY32GJR0RKB1&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Bib** - These rolled up nicely and were soft. 
https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Baby-Bibs-Easily-Clean/dp/B082GQR5CQ/ref=sr_1_37?keywords=silicon+bib&qid=1639721679&sr=8-37

**Baby Toothbrush** - Used to gently massage the gums after milk.
https://www.amazon.com/FridaBaby-Babys-First-Toothbrush-Months/dp/B07JXNL2F5/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=baby%2Btoothbrush&qid=1639721712&sr=8-8&th=1


### Diapering
**Baby Wipes** - We liked these the most because of one simple thing....when I pilled one wipe out, only one would come out. For other brands, they would chain together and so I would end up pulling an endless amount of wipes each time....which I get, you end up going through more and so the company would make more money, but it was really frustrating. We felt these also cleaned well enough.
https://www.amazon.com/WaterWipes-Sensitive-Wipes-Count-Packs/dp/B008KJEYLO/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=baby+waterwipes&qid=1639718060&sr=8-4

**Diaper Rash Cream** - Our little one had random bouts of diaper rash and this worked well at keeping it at bay. We also used a hair dryer to dry the area so that moisture wasn't trapped.
https://www.amazon.com/Desitin-Maximum-Strength-Diaper-Prevention/dp/B00ZQXT4EY/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1LNU7VLM2Q58Z&keywords=desitin+butt+cream&qid=1639718151&sprefix=desitin+bu%2Caps%2C227&sr=8-3

**Diaper Pail** - We didn't want to use special bags, so we ended up going with this pail, which we really liked a lot for the nursery. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00821FLSU?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I14FQ9CBUYRPP2&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Changing Pad** - Must have as well. We ended up not buying a changing station as we ended up putting this changing pad on top of a dresser, which worked nicely for us.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009EDSWJA?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I17GB9O4025W2V&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

### Bathtime
**Baby Towel** - Honestly, we didn't really need this as we ended up using regular bath towels, but our little one was SUPER cute in these. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QR384N7?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I2IIWMHVBBNK8M&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Baby Wash** - We ended up opting for a pump as it was super convenient to use.
https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Dove-Wash-Rich-Moisture/dp/B06X6CRHY7/ref=sr_1_33?keywords=baby+shampoo&qid=1639718519&sr=8-33

**Baby Bath Tub** - This was a 3-stage tub, which was helpful as our little one grew.
https://www.amazon.com/Skip-Hop-Moby-Smart-Sling/dp/B07FK7BG98/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=baby+bathtub&qid=1639718564&sr=8-12

**Bath Rinser** - Didn't get why we needed this, but after using it once, it all made sense. Before this I was using something stiff, like a plastic cup, which was fine, but this held more water and I didn't worry about bonking our little one on the head.
https://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Duckling-Bath-Rinser-Yellow/dp/B07YNL9ZBZ/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=bath+tub+rinser&qid=1639718618&s=baby-products&sr=1-6

### Activity & Gear
**Bouncer** - We didn't get as much use out of this as we thought we would, but some parents swear by it. Our little one didn't know how to bounce, and but by the time he learned how to bounce, he was too heavy for it. Oh well.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C7KWB26?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I33LGF9W1WGTKE&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Baby Carrier** - We ended up using this a fair amount for walks and quick trips out where a stroller would have been too much.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K99ZYR8?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I2SYSNYMEXIZFO&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Travel Crib** - We went on a trip at 4 months and this was a lifesaver. Fairly light and easy to unpack/pack. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AKKDSNG?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=I16IQ2AWRZKLEG&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Gym** - After using it, makes sense why it has so many positive reviews.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072LPBHY8?colid=1A1IPTXLJVH6S&coliid=IX4AF0O5SJS03&ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link

**Piano Gym** - We were gifted this and our little one liked this one the most. He would spend so much time under it and the gym was able to grow with him. 
https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Deluxe-Kick-Play-Piano/dp/B076HYFZ37/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=baby+gym+piano&qid=1639718952&s=baby-products&sr=1-2

**Swing** - We were gifted this and it was absolutely adored by our little one. Sometimes it would be the only thing that could calm him down. 
https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Meadows-Deluxe-Cradle-Motion/dp/B07WRST8WN/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=baby+swing&qid=1639721766&sr=8-12

**Wooden Organizer** - We used this in our litte one's playroom. Simple and stury.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VMNTPTC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1


### Clothing
**Footies** - We were gifted almost all our clothing, so we ended up buying very little. In general, one piece suits (called footies) with two way zippers were our most used clothing. 

https://www.amazon.com/s?k=baby+footies&ref=nb_sb_noss_2

**MagneticMe** - We also bought a few magneticmes, which were nice, but honestly not necessary.
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=magneticme&ref=nb_sb_noss_2


**Teether Bib** - These doubled as a bib and convenient teether.
https://www.amazon.com/Teethers-Absorbent-Polyester-Baby-Bazzle/dp/B081KSDFM4/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=bazzle+baby+teether&qid=1639721541&sr=8-5

### Put in my mouth
**Teether** - Honestly, a lot of teethers work well, but here were some of our litte one's favorites. Yummmm...

https://www.amazon.com/Chewbeads-Gramercy-Teething-Stroller-Strollers/dp/B01MG8ZSWX/ref=sr_1_34?keywords=baby+teethers&qid=1639722071&s=home-garden&sr=1-34

## Birth
### What to expect
May the odds be ever in your favor
